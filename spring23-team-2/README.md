# Team 2 Fair Housing Discrimination 
## Introduction & Methodology

The goal of this project is to investigate discrimination in the Boston housing market by analyzing a variety of data sets to make conclusions based on our findings. Councilor Louijuene wants the teams to examine bank lending discrimination at the neighborhood level. Our research and analysis will reveal possible answers to questions on mortgage lending, approval rates, and other factors that may or may not influence bank lending decisions on applicants. For factors that may impact decision approval, we will analyze factors such as income, debt-to-income ratio, ethnicity, race, income, marital status and residency.

To find these conclusions we converted flex files to CSV files, then used data from multiple different CSV files such as the HMDA dataset and `income-restricted-inventory2021`. By doing this, we were able to extract the data columns needed to make comparisons and draw conclusions on the Boston metropolitan housing market. We made Folium maps to plot out the geographical distribution of the top five zip codes with the highest amount of income restricted units and compared it to the top five zip codes with the least amount of affordable housing units. To get the code running, it would simply need to be mounted to a google drive, or just have the CSVs uploaded to the file section. 

## Navigating and Executing the Files

Deliverable 0- Deliverable 0 contains our deciding the goal of the whole project and the steps we need to take. We contacted each other for the distribution for the work in the future.

Deliverable 1- This folder contains some of our starting code and questions we were tackling. This is where some of the datasets that were in consideration for use in the final draft can be seen referenced. This was also where we got some of the first bar chart distributions comparing the amount of loans given in each zip code and district.

Deliverable 2- Our deliverable 2 entails the code necessary for the Folium maps which lay out a visual geographic distribution of the zip codes with the most and least affordable housing units. The folder titled Deliverable 2.1 has the code for the bar chart distribution of zip codes with and without affordable housing, as well as the code for the exact numbers extracted from the data columns to see how many units of each type each zip code and neighborhood has. The Folder titled Deliverable 2.3 includes the code used to conclude the zip codes with the most and least units. The folder titled Deliverable 2.2 is a bar chart contrasting loan amount with race and sex to see if there are any trends of discrimination visibly present right off the bat. Lastly, the folder titled Deliverable 2 Folium are the maps produced of the top 5 highest and lowest zip codes/neighborhoods in terms of number of affordable housing units.

Deliverable 3- This contains the draft for the final report of the spark project. 

Daniel Celaj: I made a few new graphs and updated some formatting in the final draft. I also wrote one of the extension question sections exploring the significance of various variables on housing loan acceptance, which was then revised by Sophie to be more approachable with the tools we had at our disposal. I ended up looking at and plotting the relationships between income, race, and loan acceptance, and comparing the various charts generated to get a better visualization of discrimination in housing even when income is factored. Also I reviewed and corrected some minor mistakes in the entire paper.

Deliverable 3 contained all information on checkpoint B as well as our rough draft of the final report.

Deliverable 4- This contains everything on our findings that we presented to the client to receive feedback on. It includes code on heat maps showing the relationship between race, loan type and loan amount, a stacked barchart to show race, loan distribution and the status of the loan, 2 charts showing race and loan denial and one showing race, sex and loan denial percentage. There is a surplus of information that led to our conclusion from the data. The data from this code was derived from the HMDA dataset, inventory restricted housing 2021, and census blocks. There are about 20 figures in the final report that we can collect over the course as justification for our findings that you will find.
