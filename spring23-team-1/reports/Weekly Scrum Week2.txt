CS 506: Team1
Weekly Scrum Report:  Week2

Weekly summary:
	This week, we held the first kick off meeting. All team members have completed the When2meet time sheet. We schedule a meeting with the PM next week for the client meeting to make sure every group member will fit the meeting time. 

Deliverable Key question
1.Any additional challenges you have encountered?
We still need to examine the data and decide how to preprocess the data, since the dataset (HMDA Dataset) is a lot of natural language data so we might need to do simple one-hot or PCA to eliminate some degree of dimensions if it is necessary. Need further discussion with team leader and PR for the data processing. 

2. What were the expected next steps, and did you follow them or did the scope change?
Once we figure out the data and the milestone, we can start the project and try things out. 

3. What are you planning to do to complete your project?
After attending the meeting hosted by our PM(in the near future), we will have a better understanding of the Councilor Louijueneâ€™s requests by prioritizing the tasks. In the meeting, we will discuss the following questions including: what socially vulnerable groups in the Boston neighborhoods should we priortize when collecting data(eg. racial background, income, people with disabilities, age, etc ). 

Next week plan: 
Achieve Check point A: 
	Collect and pre-process a preliminary batch of data
Perform a preliminary analysis of the data
