CS 506: Team1
Weekly Scrum Report:  Deliverable 0

1. What is the project focus/overall goal?

The project helps to understand if there is discrimination in lending/ banking for individuals seeking home ownership at the neighborhood level by examining who is participating in first-time homeownership programs and who is receiving loans and purchasing homes. 
We will use several datasets from MCBC, Analyze Boston, HMDA, and Cityofboston, which provide information about real estate, population income, and mortgage lending. By analyzing the current distribution of landlords and housing listed in affordable housing programs by county, demographics of first-time-home-ownership participants, and mortgage lending by country, we will be able to identify the demographic profile of the census block groups by neighborhood level. With the data collected and detailed analysis, we will eventually answer the questions about the current distribution of landlords in the context of affordable housing programs and further our interests with the extension of the project. 

2. Why is this project important?

This project will help to address a critical issue of affordable housing and home ownership, which has a significant impact on the everyday life of many vulnerable social groups and communities in Boston. Our project will make it possible for owner-occupied homes and small landlords to be included in a database of affordable housing units that would be made accessible to renters who met the requirements for affordable housing. The improved availability of affordable housing units and access to home ownership can greatly grant larger populations access to a home regardless of their income or background. The project will impact people's ability to live comfortably and will help build Boston communities that are just and equal.


3. What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?

We will be collecting Data set that specifies owner occupied and the number of units in different neighborhoods of Boston. Specifically, we will research and analyze the current record of home ownership considering who are receiving loans and who are purchasing homes. Together with the demographics of first-time-home-ownership participants, data of mortgage loans by county, probabilistic estimate of ethnicity/demographic information from Namsor, we will be able to find the relation between the mortgage approvements and the individuals seeking home ownership. Thus, it is a mixed type of data including personal information, geo-information about housing, and mortgage lending data.

4. What are potential limitations of the project?

Data Quality: The accuracy and completeness of the data sources used, such as the Property Assessment data and the demographic information, may affect the validity of the results.

Ethnicity/Demographic Information: Using Namsor to estimate the ethnicity and demographic information of individuals based on their names is not a 100% match and may introduce biases or inaccuracies in the analysis.

Geographical Granularity: The level of geographical granularity may not be fine enough to accurately capture the differences between neighborhoods. For example, neighborhoods within the same zip code may have different housing markets and ownership patterns, but this may not be captured in the analysis.

First-Time Homeownership Programs: The data on who is participating in first-time homeownership programs may not be complete or up-to-date, which could impact the analysis.
Data Privacy: The data used in this project may contain sensitive personal information, and the team will need to take appropriate measures to protect the privacy of individuals and comply with data privacy regulations.

5. What are your next steps? (Divide tasks amongst the team)

Review project description and determine questions or clarifications needed from the client: 
One team member can be responsible for reviewing the project description and creating a list of questions or clarifications needed from the client. They can reach out to the client to get answers to these questions.

Create a work plan: 
The team can work together to create a detailed work plan that outlines the tasks needed to complete the project and the timeline for each task. This work plan should include a breakdown of tasks into weekly sprints.

Analysis & Using the Data Sets: 
Establish home environment and examine housing by neighborhood/more granular level: one team member can be responsible for finding and accessing the Property Assessment 2022 data and the information on current owners. Another team member can be responsible for using Namsor to get a probabilistic estimate of ethnicity/demographic information.

Establish who is participating in first-time homeownership programs: 
one team member can be responsible for accessing the Census Bureau Tables and the Demographics Social Vulnerability Index & Census Block Groups data. Another team member can be responsible for accessing the Mortgage Lending Dashboards and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data.

Extension project: 
Data Sets & Sources: after the group has decided on the topic of the extension project, team members can research additional data sets and sources, such as the Redlining data and the Eviction Diversion Initiative Dashboard.
Create a proposal for the extension: one team member can be responsible for creating a proposal for the extension project that the client will approve, including the extension pitch and rationale, the questions to be answered for analysis, the datasets & sources to be used, and a pitch to the client.
Analysis: The team can work together to analyze the datasets and create visualizations.

Final Deliverable: 
The whole team can put together research results and create a report with key visualizations and answers to the client's questions. Another team member can be responsible for creating a list of owner-occupied and potential affordable housing applicants for the client to use in creating a program or project to reach out to.
